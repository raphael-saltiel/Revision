            "D. IPO of a minority stake in a subsidiary",
        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "A spin-off is when a parent company distributes shares of a subsidiary to its own shareholders, who then directly own the subsidiary. The other options describe a sale (A), a split-off (C), or a carve-out IPO (D).",

        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "Divestitures are commonly used to refocus on core businesses or to raise cash by selling non-core assets. They are not primarily about increasing leverage, eliminating tax liabilities, or avoiding disclosure requirements.",

        "question": "Q3. In a taxable divestiture, a permanent difference arises because:",
        "choices": [

        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "A permanent difference arises when the taxable gain is different from the accounting gain due to differences between tax basis and book basis. This difference does not reverse over time.",

        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "If the parent keeps control after a carve-out IPO, the subsidiary remains consolidated, and the floated part is recognized as a non-controlling interest. It is not fully deconsolidated or treated like financial investments.",

        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "Private sales are negotiated deals with a limited set of bidders under NDAs, so confidentiality is a key feature. They are not particularly transparent, and due diligence is a core part of the process.",

        "question": "Q6. In US practice, equity carve-outs have typically involved sales of:",
        "choices": [

            "D. More than 50% of the subsidiary",
        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "Historically, many US equity carve-outs float a minority stake of under about 20% so that the parent retains control and certain tax or accounting advantages.",

        "question": "Q7. How does a split-off differ from a spin-off?",

        ],
        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "In a split-off, shareholders choose to exchange their parent company shares for subsidiary shares. In a spin-off, all shareholders usually receive subsidiary shares pro rata without surrendering parent shares.",

        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "Spin-offs are often treated as a dividend in kind: the carrying amount of the net assets distributed is charged to retained earnings, reducing that account.",

        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "An equity carve-out IPO sells a minority stake in the subsidiary to public investors, generating cash while the parent typically keeps control of the subsidiary.",
    },
    {
        "question": "Q10. A spin-off requires a traded valuation because:",
        "choices": [
            "A. Tax rules always demand it",

            "D. Parent equity must be fully retired",
        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "Having a traded valuation (e.g., from an IPO or listing) provides a clear market price for the subsidiary, facilitating valuation and communication with investors.",

        ],
        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "Regulators can require the sale of assets or business units to preserve competition in a market, so antitrust concerns are a well-known driver of divestitures.",

            "B. False",
        ],

        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "In the Merton model, shareholders have a residual claim after debt is repaid, which is mathematically equivalent to a call option on the firm’s assets with a strike price equal to the face value of debt.",

        "answer": 1,

            "D. Has negative value",
        ],
        "answer": 2,
        "explanation": "When EV is near the debt level, small changes in asset value have a large impact on equity, making equity highly levered and volatile. This corresponds to high option value.",

        "answer": 1,
